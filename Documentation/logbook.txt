Revision 39:
New Feature: Translation.
Description: Translator class and language.xml file added. First translations implemented, based on [region] and [uid].
             A button or static text field needs a unique [uid] in its [region] to be translatable. A [region] is a 
             page, or popup window of the game. The [region] "General" is used for gamewide identical translations, like
             "Ok", "Cancel", aso.
TODO: add unique [uid] to buttons or text fields to make them translatable. Use Translator class to get the translated string
      into the content of button or text field. See code for examples.
TODO: Read available languages from file and use this for language setting menu.
TODO: connect unit conversion to the translation and store the conversion scheme or a selection in the xml file.
TODO: cleanup code. Consolide all things which have to do with translations and culture settings. Store actual language setting
      in systems registry. Read systems registry on game start for language configuration. If none is set, start in en-US.
TODO: Create LanguageEditor for comfortable editing and extending the language.xml file
TODO: Check possibilities for storing and loading a precompiled binary language file copy, to speed up game start.
